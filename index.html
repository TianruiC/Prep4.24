      <h2>Lie Situation</h2>
      <h3>Sometimes, telling a lie allows you to tell the truth better. I would like to say counterexample is somehow a lie that can help us to tell the truth better. Most of the time, it's hard to prove something is correct directly in math or our life, we need to lie to ourself or others bt giving them a counterexample. When we assume the counterexample is correct, by putting it into the context, we will immediately find out the counterexample is actually truth and proving the thing are correct.</h3>
